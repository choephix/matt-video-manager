| **Publish**            | The atomic operation that uploads to Dropbox, freezes the Draft Version as a Published Version (setting name/description), and clones a new Draft Version | Commit, Deploy, Push                |
| **Export Version Key** | A hardcoded constant in the codebase (`EXPORT_VERSION`) that, when bumped, invalidates all video export hashes and forces re-export                       | Version number, Build version       |

## Relationships

- A **Course** is either a **Ghost Course** (no file path, planning-only) or backed by a **CourseRepo** on disk, referenced via `repoPath`
- A **Ghost Course** becomes a real **Course** permanently when a file path is assigned during **Materialization Cascade**; a real course never reverts to ghost
- A **Course** contains one or more **CourseVersions**
- A **Course** has exactly one **Draft Version** (the latest CourseVersion) and zero or more **Published Versions**
- A **CourseVersion** contains ordered **Sections**
- A **Section** contains ordered **Lessons**
- A **Lesson** contains zero or more **Videos** (ghost lessons have none)
- A **Video** contains ordered **Clips** and **ClipSections**, interleaved in a shared ordering space
- A **Video** with at least one **Clip** has an **Export Hash**; a video with no clips is not considered a real video
- An **Exported Video** file is shared across **CourseVersions** via `{courseId}-{exportHash}.mp4` naming — if clips haven't changed, the hash matches and no re-export is needed
- A **Standalone Video** belongs directly to a **Course** with no **Lesson** parent
- A **Recording Session** produces multiple **Optimistic Clips** that become **Clips** on persistence
- A **Plan** is independent of the **Course** hierarchy and contains **PlanSections** with **PlanLessons**
- **Publishing** uploads to Dropbox, freezes the **Draft Version** into a **Published Version**, and creates a new **Draft Version** — all atomically (Dropbox upload must succeed first)

## Example dialogue (updated)

> **Dev:** "When a user wants to push changes to the course, what's the flow?"

> **Domain expert:** "They go to the Publish page. It shows them a changelog preview — the diff between the current **Draft Version** and the last **Published Version**. They enter a name and description, and hit Publish."

> **Dev:** "What if some videos haven't been exported yet?"

> **Domain expert:** "The Publish page checks every **Video** that has **Clips** for a matching **Exported Video** on disk. If any are **Unexported Videos**, the publish button is disabled and they see export buttons inline. A **Video** with no **Clips** is ignored — it's not a real video."

> **Dev:** "How does the system know if a video needs re-export?"

> **Domain expert:** "It computes the **Export Hash** from the clip filenames, timestamps, order, and the **Export Version Key**. Then it checks for `{courseId}-{exportHash}.mp4`. If the file exists, it's already exported. If not, it's an **Unexported Video**."

> **Dev:** "What happens when we bump the **Export Version Key**?"

> **Domain expert:** "Every video's **Export Hash** changes, so nothing matches on disk anymore. Everything becomes an **Unexported Video** and needs re-export."

> **Dev:** "What if I want to free up disk space without re-exporting everything?"

> **Domain expert:** "You can **Purge** — either a single video or all exports for a version. Purging deletes the `.mp4` from disk, so the video becomes an **Unexported Video** again. You can always re-export later."

> **Dev:** "After publishing, what happens to old exported files with stale hashes?"

> **Domain expert:** "Automatic cleanup happens at export time — we collect all valid **Export Hashes** across every **CourseVersion**, then delete any `{courseId}-*.mp4` files whose hash isn't in that set. That's different from a manual **Purge**, which is a deliberate user action."

> **Dev:** "And the **Published Version** is immutable? Can it be deleted?"

> **Domain expert:** "Correct. Once published, the version's name, description, and structure are frozen. It cannot be deleted. The **Draft Version** is always the only mutable version."

## Example dialogue: ghost courses (new)

> **Dev:** "What if I want to plan a course but don't have a repo yet?"

> **Domain expert:** "Create a **Ghost Course** — just give it a name. You can add **Ghost Sections** and **Ghost Lessons** freely. It's pure planning, no filesystem needed."

> **Dev:** "What happens when I'm ready to commit one of those lessons to disk?"

> **Domain expert:** "Hit 'Create Real Lesson.' Since the course is a **Ghost Course**, it triggers a **Materialization Cascade** — a modal asks you to point at an existing directory for the file path. Then the **Course**, **Section**, and **Lesson** all **Materialize** in one step."

> **Dev:** "Can the course go back to ghost if I delete that lesson?"

> **Domain expert:** "No. Once a **Course** has a file path, it stays real forever. The repo on disk doesn't disappear just because you removed a lesson."

> **Dev:** "What about deleting a real lesson entirely — not converting to ghost?"

> **Domain expert:** "There's a 'Delete' action that purges from disk and removes from the database in one step. Separate from 'Convert to Ghost,' which keeps the planning entry."

## Flagged ambiguities

- **"Version"** — Used both for **CourseVersion** (structural snapshots) and implicitly for content history via `previousVersionLessonId`/`previousVersionSectionId` cross-references. These serve different purposes: one is a named milestone, the other is a migration link between versions. Now additionally distinguished as **Draft Version** vs **Published Version** by position (latest = draft).
- **Clips and ClipSections share an ordering space** — Both use the same `order` field with fractional indexing. The UI must treat them as a single interleaved list, not two separate collections. This is a source of complexity when inserting or reordering.
- **"Plan" vs course structure** — A **Plan** (`plans` table) is entirely disconnected from the **Course**/Section/Lesson hierarchy. There is no enforced link between a **PlanLesson** and an actual **Lesson**. The relationship is purely semantic.
- **"Export Version Key" vs "CourseVersion"** — These are unrelated concepts that both use the word "version." The **Export Version Key** is a build-time constant for cache-busting video exports. A **CourseVersion** is a domain snapshot of course structure. Do not confuse them.
- **"Clear" / "Delete from file system"** (resolved) — Previously used interchangeably for removing exported video files. Now canonicalized as **Purge**. "Clear" described the mechanism (clearing files), not the domain action. **Purge** captures the intent: deliberately removing a cached render artifact to transition a video back to Unexported status.
- **"Delete" for lessons** (new) — "Delete" now means two different things depending on context: for a **Ghost Lesson**, it removes the DB row. For a real **Lesson**, it purges from disk AND removes from DB. This is distinct from "Convert to Ghost" which only removes from disk. The UI should make the distinction clear through labeling.
